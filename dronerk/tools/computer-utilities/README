1: Open dronegcc in a text editor and set git_directory to your DroneRK git path
2: Give these scripts execute permission: chmod +x drone droneftp dronegcc
3: Copy them to /usr/bin: sudo cp drone droneftp dronegcc /usr/bin/

Now you can use all three as standard unix commands.
dronegcc: compile programs for the drone
drone: telnet into the drone
droneftp: FTP to the drone, then telnet into the drone
