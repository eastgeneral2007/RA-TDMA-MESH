good example of uav application that sends/receive actuation/sensor data, as well as 802.11pkts
there is a string sent periodically to some userinput destination.
run:
./uav_sim 1 1 2
and also
./uav_sim 2 0 0 
to initiate two UAVs (#1 and #2), where #1 sends string messages to #2

note:compile libclock first, the library that interfaces with simulator clock.
