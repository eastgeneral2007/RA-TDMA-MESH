viz.m is the "VIZUALIZER" of the simulator.
it is written in matlab script and draws the current positions and tracks of the UAVs by reading a shared memory that the uav_simulator process is updating.

in console, open a matlab session without GUI:

$ matlab -nodesktop

Then run the network vizualizer 

>> run viz


before opening this vizualizer, please run ./uav_simulator <n>
