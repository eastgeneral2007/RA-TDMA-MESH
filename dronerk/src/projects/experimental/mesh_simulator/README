a simple example of uav application that sends/receive actuation/sensor data, as well as 802.11pkts
there is a string sent periodically to some <dst> destination.
run:
./uav_sim <myid> <sender?> <dst>

run this example:
./uav_sim 1 1 2
and also
./uav_sim 2 0 1 
to initiate two UAVs (#1 and #2), where #1 sends string messages to #2

IMPORTANT NOTES:
Compile all important shared libraries:
1)libdrk (for ardrone2.0 motion and sensing) - go to $DRK_ROOT/src/libs/drk_api and run ./sim_make.sh
2)libsbp (piksi gps) - go to $DRK_ROOT/src/libs/libsbp and run ./simmake.sh
